# code-assistant

As part of my graduate project I developed this web app which consists of an assistant to learn Python from scratch. Application that demonstrates my ability to design scalable architecture, write clean, tested code, and ship features rapidly. 

During this process I learned a lot about generative artificial intelligence and how it can help the learning process by giving updated information that help the students to improve their programming skills.
